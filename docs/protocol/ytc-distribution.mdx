### YTC Distribution & Supply Expansion

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of YTC is greater than 1.01, new YTC will be minted in the [Boardroom](https://docs.yeti.ink/docs/protocol/boardroom).

The amount of new YTC distributed depends on our position above peg and also the current circulating supply of YTC.
