To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Yeti ink. protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with YSHARE to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total YSHARE rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* YTC-WBTC LP: 25% of YSHARE rewards
* YSHARE-FTM LP: 25% of YSHARE rewards
* YTC Single Stake: 50% of YSHARE rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of YSHARE (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the YSHARE farms started on November 25th, 2021. YSHARE will always continue to print YTC in the Boardroom, though, as long as YTC remains above peg.

:::danger YSHARE reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on November 25th, 2022 once the total YSHARE supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When YTC is pegged or close to being pegged at 10,000 YTC to 1 BTC, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if BTC pumps, YTC pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If BTC pumps in price, it won't "outrun" YTC, even if nobody is buying YTC at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If BTC rises in USD value, YTC goes with it. Similarly, if BTC falls in USD value, YTC will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.


:::note Note: The only thing that can change the price of YTC in terms of its BTC value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
