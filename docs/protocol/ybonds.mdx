### What are bonds (YBOND)?

Bonds are unique tokens that can be utilized to help stabilize YTC price around peg (10,000 YTC = 1 BTC) by reducing the circulating supply of YTC if the TWAP (time-weighted average price) goes below peg.

### When can I buy bonds (YBOND)?

YBOND can be purchased only during periods of supply contraction and when the TWAP of YTC is below 1.

At the beginning of every new epoch during contraction periods, YBONDs are issued in the amount of 3% of YTC's circulating supply, with a max debt amount of 35%. This means that if bonds reach 35% of the circulating supply of YTC, no more bonds will be issued.

:::note Note that during a zen epoch (when an epoch ends with a TWAP between 1.0 - 1.01), **no YBOND will be issued, even though the Boardroom does not print.**

:::

:::danger YBOND TWAP (time-weighted average price) is based on the YTC TWAP from the previous epoch as it ends. In other words, the YTC TWAP is real-time but the YBOND TWAP is not.

### Where can I buy bonds (YBOND)?

You can buy YBONDs if any are available through [yeti.ink](https://app.yeti.ink/bond) in the [Pit](https://app.yeti.ink/bond). Anyone can buy as many YBONDs as they want as long as they have enough YTC to pay for them.

There is a limit of available YBONDs per epoch during contraction periods (3% of YTC's current  circulating supply), and are sold first-come-first-serve.

### Why should I buy bonds (YBOND)?

The first and most important reason to buy YBOND is that they help to maintain the peg, but they are not the only measure in place to keep the protocol on track.&#x20;

YBONDs don't have an expiration date, so you can view them as an investment in the long-term health of the protocol to be redeemed for a premium at a later date.

#### Incentives for Holding YBOND

The idea is to reward YBOND buyers for helping the protocol, while also protecting the protocol from being manipulated by big players.

So after you buy YBOND using YTC, you have two possible ways to get your YTC back:

1. Sell back your YBOND for YTC **while the peg is between 1 - 1.1** (10,000 YTC = 1 WBTC) with no redemption bonus. This is in place to prevent an instant dump as soon as peg is recovered.
2. Sell back your YBOND for YTC **while the peg is above 1.1** (10,000 YTC = 1 WBTC) with a bonus redemption rate.

The longer you hold, the more both the protocol and you benefit from YBOND.

:::tip
Example:

1. When YTC = 0.8, burn 1 YTC to get 1 YBOND (YBOND price = 0.8)
2. When YTC = 1.15, redeem 1 YBOND to get 1.105 YTC (YBOND price = 1.27)&#x20;

:::

So, which one is better?

If I buy YTC at 0.8, and hold it until 1.15 and then sell, I'm getting +$0.35 per YTC.

But, if I buy YTC at 0.8, burn it for YBOND, and redeem it at 1.15, I'm getting 1.105 YTC \* 1.15 (YTC current price) = 1,271 (+$0.47) per YBOND redeemed.

But, what if getting back to peg is taking too long?

We will adjust our use cases to have different behaviors on contraction and expansion periods to benefit both YTC and YBOND holders when needed.

### What is the formula to calculate the redemption bonus for YBOND?

To encourage the redemption of YBOND for YTC when YTC's TWAP > 1.1 and in order to incentivize users to redeem bonds at a higher price, YBOND redemption is designed to be more profitable with a higher YTC TWAP value. The YBOND to YTC ratio is 1:R, where R can be calculated using the formula as shown below:

### When can I swap YBOND for a premium?

You can only redeem YBONDs for a premium when the previous epoch's TWAP is greater than 1.1.
