### What is xYTC?

xYTC is a utility token for the YTC protocol. You must hold xYTC in your wallet to be able to vote on decisions that will shape the future of YTC. The more xYTC you hold, the more power your vote will carry.

### How Does xYTC Work?

YTC can be exchanged to and from xYTC at any time on our [xYTC page](https://app.yeti.ink/xytc).

When xYTC was launched, the ratio of YTC to xYTC was exactly 1.0. At a ratio of 1.0, if you deposited 100 YTC, you would receive 100 xYTC in return. And, similarly, if you redeemed 100 xYTC, you would receive 100 YTC back.

xYTC is only minted when YTC is deposited into the contract.  Any time YTC is sent to the xYTC smart contract as rewards, it will increase the ratio of YTC to xYTC, generating a yield for all xYTC holders.

### Example

John deposits 10,000 YTC into xYTC staking, when the exchange is 1.0. John receives 10,000 xYTC in return for his 10,000 YTC.

Other users stake a combined 90,000 additional YTC, making the total staked amount of YTC 100,000.

Now we have 100,000 xYTC in total, and 100,000 YTC in the xYTC staking contract.

10,000 YTC are now sent to the xYTC reward contract, making the total amount of YTC in the contract 110,000 now (learn where YTC rewards come from below).

Since the total amount of xYTC is still 100,000, but the YTC shared among stakers is 110,000, the exchange rate (ratio) will now be 1.1 YTC per xYTC.

John can now redeem his 10,000 xYTC to receive 11,000 YTC in return.

Any new YTC deposits at this point will receive xYTC at the current exchange rate of 1 xYTC per 1.1 YTC (as per this example).

### How Does xYTC Get Additional YTC?

There are numerous sources of YTC for the xYTC holders:

* Between January 24th and February 7th, 50,000 YTC will be deposited into the xYTC smart contract to benefit early stakers. That is an average of over 3,500 YTC per day, over $10,000 USD per day during this period!
* 20% of all YTC minted on expansionary epochs will be deposited for xYTC holders. This comes from the protocols YTC allocation and has no negative impact on BSHARE staking.
* 80% of all fees collected from the autocompounding vaults will be used to buy YTC on the open market and deposited for xYTC holders.
