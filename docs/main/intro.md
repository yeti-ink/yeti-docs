Welcome to Yeti Defi! If this is your first time here, please take some time to read through this documentation before you begin using the protocol. This documentation is intended to take you through the entire process of how to get started using Yeti Defi to earn stable, high yields that are only possible through the power of DeFi, but with the stability and security of exposure to Bitcoin, the world's largest and most coveted crypto asset. Let's dive in!

### Getting Started

The algorithmic mechanics of maintaining a peg to Bitcoin (BTC) at a 10,000 to 1 ratio will be identical to Tomb Finance..

There is little to be gained by rebuilding the wheel, many people will copy a DeFi protocol verbatim without sparing a thought for building upon the concept.

In our view, these are blatant cash grabs, we can see with TOMB forks that have taken place on Avalanche and BSC that they have cloned a protocol for an ecosystem token that has already realized insane gains. There is unlikely to be a 100x of $AVAX and $BNB for the remainder of this bull market. The lemon has already been squeezed. 

Potential gains aside, we believe it is our responsibility when relying on the brilliant work of the Tomb Finance team to advance the experiment further.

**So, what good is that?** We will explore this idea further throughout this documentation, but for now without getting too technical, this opens up a world of possibilities for existing, long-time Bitcoin holders, people already familiar with DeFi, as well as new users just coming into the space.

Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. There are not nearly as many attractive yield earning opportunities in DeFi for people to put their precious Bitcoin to work for them. $YTC, through the Yeti protocol, can solve many of these problems and more, generating immense value for our users in the process.

As the Yeti ink ecosystem grows over time, the potential future applications are quite literally endless. And, as you proceed through this documentation and learn more about how the Yeti ink. protocol works, we will explore some of that potential in more detail.
