### How does it work?

The Yeti protocol works through a synergistic design of unique tokens and mechanisms that create an automatic, self-reinforcing system to help maintain the peg (10,000 YTC = 1 Bitcoin). Each of these tokens and mechanisms will be explained in further detail within this documentation, but for now let's have a look at a brief overview of how it all works:

* When **YTC price is over the peg**, new YTC are minted by the protocol to inflate the supply in an attempt to drive the price down towards the peg. These new YTC are allocated to YSHARE holders in the Boardroom, as a reward for their investment and trust in the protocol. This in turn increases the demand for and the value of YSHARE.
* When **YTC price is at the peg**, no new YTC will be minted, keeping the supply fixed during this time. Since there will be no new supply coming in, the peg will be maintained indefinitely at this point unless there is a shift in demand. More buying pressure during this time will push the price back up above the YTC minting threshold. Conversely, more selling pressure will push the price below the peg.
* When **YTC price drops below the peg**, the protocol will begin to mint BBONDs (up to a maximum debt limit). Experienced investors will have the ability to exchange their YTC for these YBOND, which they can then redeem for YTC at a premium above peg in the future. This removes YTC from the total supply, applying upward pressure on the price towards the peg. Besides this, investors who believe in the protocol's ability to maintain peg can just buy YTC to essentially purchase Bitcoin at a discount to the market. Both of these incentives are intended to create upward pressure on YTC's price when under the peg so that the peg can be regained over time. YTC staking (xBOMB), and other features of the protocol that will be discussed later, also help limit YTC supply and apply upward pressure on the price during this time.

:::info There are so many different ways you can utilize the mechanisms of the Yeti protocol to earn yield. Pick a strategy that is right for you, based upon your own knowledge and experience. Even the most simple and basic of strategies can earn great returns, but feel free to experiment with more complex strategies as you learn how the protocol works!

### What exactly is the peg?

YTC is a token that is intended to track the price of Bitcoin (BTC) algorithmically. The ratio for this peg is set at 10,000 YTC to 1 BTC. YTC **actively tracks this peg via an algorithm**, but that **does not mean** it will be valued at 10,000 YTC to 1 BTC at all times as **it is not collateralized**. **YTC is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.**&#x20;

The entire design of the Yeti protocol is intended to try and maintain this peg as closely as possible, but as it is an algorithmic peg, this will never be a completely stable process. In fact, some of the unique profit-generating opportunities offered by the protocol actually only exist because of these price fluctuations.

To put it simply, there will **almost certainly be times when the price of YTC is below peg**. This is a natural part of the process, and opens up opportunities for active investors/traders to "buy the dip" and help support the protocol by regaining peg, while also profiting from the discounted price.

When the protocol is healthy and stable, the price of YTC will likely look similar to above, with price fluctuating above and below peg as the mechanisms of the protocol work to influence supply and demand and maintain an average price around the peg.

Keep this in mind when developing your strategies and when taking a more active role in the protocol.
