Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using Yeti ink. to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

:::caution The strategies described here are intended only to illustrate how to use the Yeti ink. protocol and do not constitute financial advice. Always do your own research and make your own decisions with regard to how you use Yeti ink.

### âœ¨YTC-WBTC Liquidity Pool Autocompounding Vault Strategy

This is the most simple and consistent strategy for new users, as it requires the fewest steps and the least effort to maintain (as in, zero effort). This option maintains the maximum amount of exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) while still earning incredible yields that automatically compound every two hours.

If you're already holding YTC and WBTC in your wallet and know how to throw that into the liquidity pool for LP tokens, you can do that manually if you like. (Refer to the Provide LP section for instructions on how to do this if you are interested.) But, our autocompounder vault can also do this automatically for you, which is the method we recommend. (Check out the documentation on our Autocompounding Vaults if you have any questions about how to use them.)

### Semi-active Restaking Strategy

Once you have familiarized yourself with the Yeti ink. protocol and how everything works, you might be interested to try a more active and advanced strategy to diversify your passive income streams and potentially increase yields.
One way to do this would be to buy some YTC and pair it with WBTC to receive YTC-WBTC LP tokens. (Refer to the Provide LP section for instructions on how to do this.) You can then stake those LP tokens in our Farms to earn YSHARE, which you can then withdraw on a regular basis and stake in the Boardroom to earn additional YTC when above peg and the Boardroom is printing.
What you do with the YTC you earn then is up to you. You could stake it for xYTC, sell it immediately on the open market, or throw it in the YTC-WBTC LP autocompounding vault to earn even more compounding returns on those rewards.

### More Complex/Active Strategies

As the Yeti ink. ecosystem grows, more complex, advanced, and active strategies will emerge. Once you fully understand the protocol and how all its mechanisms interact, feel free to experiment.

Keep in mind these fundamental aspects of the protocol when you are thinking about how to most optimally balance your portfolio:

1. The Boardroom only prints for YSHARE stakers **when the peg** is **above 1.01**.

2. The higher YTC is above peg, the **more YTC is printed for YSHARE stakers in the Boardroom**. This makes staking YSHARE more attractive the higher above peg we currently are.

3. Conversely, YSHARE becomes less attractive as YTC dips below peg.

Ultimately, the goal of an advanced user of the protocol should be to help maintain the peg. Doing so will result in the greatest rewards for not only yourself as an individual, but for every person participating in the protocol as a whole.
Strategically rebalancing your portfolio to apply buying pressure to YTC when below peg, or selling pressure when above peg, can be a very profitable strategy, but is not without risk. As such, this type of strategy is for experienced users only.

:::tip The easiest way to earn consistent yields with Yeti ink. is always in the autocompounding vaults. Everything they do you can do manually, but require significant time for monitoring and gas fees for every transaction.
